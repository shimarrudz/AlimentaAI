# 🍽️ Alimenta-ai Solution
Platform:
Alimenta-ai aims to bring accessibility and awareness together. Our goal is to create an accessible and interactive digital platform through strategically located street kiosks that allow homeless individuals to easily and quickly access information about available meals, distribution schedules, and assistance programs. We want to ensure they have access to nutritious food and crucial information to seek support and improve their quality of life.

## 🏬 Totem System:
To enable the implementation of street kiosks for the Alimenta-AI project, we rely on partnerships and collaborations from various stakeholders. This can include non-profit organizations, private companies, government agencies, and even individuals engaged in the cause. These partnerships can be established to provide financial resources for the production and installation of the kiosks, as well as their ongoing maintenance. Community engagement is also crucial. Volunteers can collaborate in identifying strategic locations for kiosk installation and promoting the project among homeless individuals and other stakeholders. Therefore, making the Alimenta-AI street kiosks a reality is a collective effort, involving partnerships, collaborations, and community support, with the aim of creating an accessible and effective solution to help homeless individuals access the necessary information and support.

With the Alimenta-AI kiosk, homeless individuals will be able to check daily menus, detailing the meals offered at different distribution points. This way, they will have clear information about the available options. Additionally, they can request donations directly through the system, facilitating the connection between donors and those in need of support.
